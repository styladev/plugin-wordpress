#### Last updated: 24.10.2016
#### Compatibility: Wordpress 4.2.2 - 4.5.X

This Wordpress plugin provides the SEO and Routing functionality for a Styla magazine.

### Installation

1. Install and activate the following plugin to allow php in pages: https://wordpress.org/plugins/allow-php-in-posts-and-pages/

2. Copy the entire StylaMagazine folder into your wp-content/plugins folder

3. Activate the StylaMagazine plugin in Wordpress

4. Go to **Settings -> StylaMagazine** and configure the plugin (see [Configuration](#configuration)). Click "Save Changes" when ready.

5. Add `[php] styla_body(); [/php]` on the page the magazine should be placed

6. Go to **Settings -> Permalinks** and hit the "Save Changes" button (you don't need to change anything on this site) - this will refresh internal redirects for all magazine urls (e.g. <magazine path>/story/asdf-1234)

### Configuration

* **Domain** - Domain name of the magazine to embed and provided by Styla. If unclear please contact support@styla.com
* **Magazine Root Path** - URL path to your magazine. Example: The rooth path for mydomain.com/magazine would be "magazine". Leave empty if your magazine is supposed to be displayed on your front page (e.g. mydomain.com/)
* **Magazine Page Slug** - Slug of the (front-)page with the `[php] styla_body(); [/php]` snippet on it. Only required when the Magazine Root Path is empty. The page slug can be found in the "Quick Edit" form of the page, see this example:

* **Content Server** - Server providing Styles and Javascript for the magazine and it's content. _Should not be changed without double-checking with Styla._
