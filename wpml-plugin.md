The [WordPress Multilingual Plugin](https://wpml.org/) sets up locale tag in your WordPress URLs structure, example: **/en/** for English. This might lead to conflicts with the Styla WP plugin which also influences routing on your website.

So if you use several languages and want to have your Styla magazine to be embedded on a page in English, the magazine URL will be: **yourdomain.com/en/magazine**. You can also change "magazine" into whatever else slag you need. In this guide we'll use "eatcleangetclean" as an example, a slug used by one of our clients.

In order for it to work with the Styla WordPress plugin, please install both (WPML and Styla) plugins and then go through the step below. As always, it's best to do this on your stage environment before going live.

**1. Create new Page called "eatcleangetclean" for English version of your website and add the php snippet and publish it. It should look like this:**

Note: The URL including the "/en/" is generated by the WPML.

**2. Go to the Styla Plugin settings and apply the following:**

**3. Go to "Settings -> Permalinks" and hit the "Save" button. You don't need to change anything on that site, just resave as it is, this will flush the wordpress cache recreate the permalinks.**

**4. That's it, your magazine should now be visible on the "/en/eatcleangetlean" URL:**

At the moment Styla plugin only supports one magazine per WordPress website. Multiple magazines may be added in the future.
